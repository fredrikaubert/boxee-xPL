# What
the xbmc.xpl plugin will xpl enable xbmc. This plugin supports the media scheme, as well as
the osd and cid schemes. Read more about [xpl](http://xplproject.org.uk/). 

#Disclaimer
This is based on the [work](https://github.com/c99koder/boxee-xPL) of [Sam Steel](https://github.com/c99koder).
I have just made some minor modifications and made it fit with the new plugin
architecture of xbmc.   

#Installation
This is early versions for betatesters. I will try to submit this plugin to the main
xbmc repository when the software has been tested for a period. In the xbmc repository they
prefer to include only stable plugins, so for now there will be the install via zip option. 

1. Download latest version [here](https://github.com/fredrikaubert/boxee-xPL/downloads)
2. In xbmc: Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file
3. Browse to where you stored the zipfile, and select it
4. Restart xbmc (known issue)
5. Voila, now xbmc should send xpl messages on the network, and respond to

This is based on the work of Sam Steel which are licensed as GNU, hence GPL is the only
